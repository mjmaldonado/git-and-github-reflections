1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- A remote repository is excellent for when you want others to be able to easily access your work who are not on your network.
- It also doesn't make sense to keep all of your work local, so you would want to use a remote repository for the commits that
- are ready to be seen by the world (if you're not using a private repository).

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- This is similar to automatic merging in that while it would be nice, it wouldn't always make sense.
- It would become particularly cumbersome when you are trying to work on a different branch to have the your master continuously change.
- This behavior would likely make it challenging to keep track of when bugs were introduced.
